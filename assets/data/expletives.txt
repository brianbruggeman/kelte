a nod’s as guid as a wink tae a blind horse
I'll gie ye a skelpit lug
Whit's fur ye'll no go by ye
Skinny Malinky Longlegs
Lang may yer lum reek
Speak o' the Devil
Black as the Earl of Hell's Wasitcoat
Failing means yer playin!
Mony a mickle maks a muckle
Keep the heid!
We're a' Jock Tamson's bairns!
Dinnae teach yer Granny tae suck eggs!
Is the cat deid?
The baw’s on the slates
Haud yer wheesht!
Noo jist haud on!
Hell slap it intae ye!
I’m fair puckled!
Do yer dinger.
Gie it laldy.
Ah dinnae ken.
Haste Ye Back!
It’s a dreich day!
